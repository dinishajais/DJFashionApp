I am creating this e commerce web application for my learning purpose.

List of erros encontered:
1. ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "users_email_key" ----->>> This indicates that in the email already exists and in db there is a constraint that duplicate db values should not be allowed.
2. Error creating bean with name 'itemRepository' : The query was wrong. The table used in the query should be same name as that of the entity class .
3. Create a DTO class if you do not want entire entity as the output but only want particular values.
4. Try keeping all the names in the db in a small case to avaoid any kind of query usage issues.
